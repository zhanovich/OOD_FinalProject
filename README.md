During the course of the class and final project I got to learn Java as I have not utilized that programming language before. Besides the syntax I got a deeper understanding of patterns and when it's best to apply them. The biggest difficulty for myself was working with different packages and making sure that all the packages are compatible with each other as I faced an issue with JUnit and current Eclipse IDE not working together. The other challenge I faced was implementing patterns in the language I am not versed at. I had a plan of including GUI for the application but after a closer research and time crunch I decided to spend more time into the implementation rather than watered down implementation and half backed GUI. I implemented MVP and have plans to incorporate GUI and functionality such as: item customization, menu management system for ease of editing menu items. I opted out to use these patterns: Iterator pattern in the Menu package, Factory pattern in the CookingStyle package, Singleton and Proxy patterns in the Loyalty package. UnitTest package contains all unit tests for the application. The current status of the project is at it's MVP state.
